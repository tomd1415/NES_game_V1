# Native Linux build plan — detailed implementation

**Status:** active. This is the single source of truth for `native/` work.

It supersedes the ranking in
[`2026-07-14-native-web-gap-audit.md`](2026-07-14-native-web-gap-audit.md): that
audit is honest about *what* is missing, but understates the gap (§1.3) and misses
the architectural root causes (§1.2) that make every item on its list expensive.
The parity tracker [`2026-07-13-native-parity.md`](2026-07-13-native-parity.md)
remains the per-feature checklist; this document is the build order.

**Audience:** whoever picks up `native/` next, human or AI. Every symbol named
here was verified against the tree on 2026-07-14; every measured number was
measured, not estimated.

---

## 1. What we are building and why

`native/` is the PySide6 Linux sibling of the browser Studio. Today it is a
**working ROM pipeline behind a prototype UI**. The goal of this plan is a native
app that (a) looks like the design guide claims, (b) has workflows a pupil can
actually follow, and (c) reaches feature parity with the web Studio.

### 1.1 What is already good — do not rewrite it

| Area | Where | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared codegen / ROM contract | `codegen/runtime.py`, `codegen/differential.py`, `core/build_request.py` | **Excellent.** Proves native and web emit byte-identical ROMs. `tests/contract/` is why that stays true. |
| Persistence | `persistence/projects.py` (`ProjectRepository`), `session.py` (`ProjectSession`), `manager.py` (`StorageManager`), `autosave.py`, `bundles.py`, `portability.py` | **Solid.** SQLite store, 500 ms debounced saves, 30 s deduplicated snapshots, atomic import/export, XDG recovery. |
| Document model | `core/project_document.py` (`ProjectDocument`, 1294 lines, ~120 mutators) | Sound data model. Its *change-notification* story is the problem (§4.2), not its contents. |
| Starters | `core/starters.py` (`StarterCatalog`), `resources/starters/` | 7 checksummed fixtures: `basics`, `geodash`, `racer`, `runner`, `scratch`, `smb`, `topdown`. |
| Threaded build | `ui/main_window.py:82` (`_BuildWorker`), `integrations/direct_build.py` (`DirectBuildController`) | Correct: builds against a detached document copy on a `QThread`. |
| **Embedded NES core** | `native/nes_core/` | **New, done, proven.** See §5. |

### 1.2 The two root causes of everything else

**Root cause A — there is no NES renderer.** The web's centrepiece is a live
256x240 framebuffer (`studio.js:183 renderLive`) painting real tiles through the
real 64-entry `NES_PALETTE_RGB` table (`sprite-render.js:29`), which each mode can
take over via `renderTV` / `onRenderOverlay`. Native has nothing equivalent:

- `ui/widgets/world_canvas.py:422` fills each cell with `NES_COLOURS[value % 4]` —
  a four-colour placebo keyed off the **tile index**. The WORLD canvas has never
  drawn the pixel art made in TILES and never applies PALS palettes.
- The same placeholder ramp `("#181828", "#4878d8", "#78d878", "#f8d878")` is
  copy-pasted 5x (`main_window.py:195,210,795,1358`, `world_canvas.py:18`) and is
  what every tile/sprite thumbnail renders with.
- `main_window.py:264 _nes_colour_swatch()` **invents** colours via
  `QColor.fromHsv((tone * 23) % 360, ...)`. PALS shows 64 colours the NES cannot
  produce.

Consequence: the CRT bezel at `main_window.py:2579` frames a screen that never
shows the game. Every visual feature is blocked behind this one missing module.

**Root cause B — `MainWindow` is a god object with no store.** 2,665 lines, 157
methods, 129 widget attributes. All 7 modes are built inline in a single 597-line
`_create_stage()` and dispatched by a nested ternary at `main_window.py:1224`.
`ui/modes/` was scaffolded for per-mode widgets and left **empty**.

There is no store and no change signal, so the UI mutates the document directly
(154 call sites) and must *manually remember* to call `schedule_save()` (66 sites)
and `_update_document_title()` (55 sites) after each edit; 77 `blockSignals()`
pairs paper over the missing data flow.

What the user feels:
- **Editing a tile in TILES does not repaint WORLD.**
- **Undo/redo works only in WORLD** (`main_window.py:2356-2362` wires the actions
  straight to `WorldCanvas.undo/redo`). Tile pixels, sprites, animations, all ~40
  RULES fields, palettes and sound are **not undoable at all**.
- `WorldCanvas.load_tiles()` (`world_canvas.py:136`) clears history
  unconditionally, so switching screen or background **wipes WORLD undo too**.

### 1.3 Scale of the parity gap

The existing audit lists 11 gaps. These whole systems are missing outright:

| System | Web | Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **STYLE mode** | `studio-style.js` — a full 8th mode | **Absent**; crammed into RULES |
| **Expertise levels** (Beginner/Maker/Advanced) | Gates modes, stage tools *and* dock sections | Absent |
| **Validators** | `builder-validators.js` (934 lines), ~20 checks + sprites-per-scanline analysis, each with a **"Fix in \<Mode\> →"** jump | Absent |
| **Guided tutorial** | 6 tutorials, lenient re-baselined checks, "Show me" flashes the real control, teacher settings | Absent |
| **Time Machine** | Browse/restore snapshots; restoring is itself undoable | Snapshots exist, **no UI** |
| **Budget meters** | CHR bg/sprite N/256, OAM N/64 | Absent |
| **Attribute-conflict display** | Red cross on 2x2 quadrants whose palettes disagree | Absent |
| **Shared-tile guard** | "Used by Villager… Duplicate first / Change everywhere / Cancel" | Absent |
| **Asset import/export** | `.chr` / `.pal` / `.nam` both ways | Absent |
| **Emulator** | In-page jsnes, audio, 2P | **Solved — see §5** |
| **Gallery / accounts** | Full | Absent (out of scope, §9) |

Native's CHARS has **no drawing canvas at all** — you edit one cell through four
spin boxes. SOUND is import-only. CODE discards the build log
(`main_window.py:2434`).

## 2. Target architecture

```
nes_studio/
  render/                 ← NEW. The single source of visual truth.
    palette.py            NES_PALETTE_RGB (64 entries, verbatim from the web)
    framebuffer.py        nametable+tiles+palettes -> QImage; tile/sprite thumbs
    screen.py             NesScreen widget: QImage at integer scale + overlay hook
  emulator/               ← NEW. Wraps native/nes_core.
    session.py            EmulatorSession: frame loop, QAudioSink, input mapping
  state/                  ← NEW. The missing store.
    store.py              DocumentStore: changed(path) signal + QUndoStack
    commands.py           QUndoCommand per edit kind
  ui/
    main_window.py        SHRINKS to shell: app bar, rail, stage, dock host, quests
    modes/                ← FILL THE EMPTY PACKAGE. One QWidget per mode.
      base.py             Mode protocol
      world.py chars.py tiles.py pals.py rules.py style.py sound.py code.py
    widgets/
      world_canvas.py     Loses its own paint logic; renders via render/
  core/ persistence/ codegen/ integrations/   ← largely unchanged
```

**The mode contract** — deliberately the same shape the web already proves out
(`studio.js:346-358`), so the two products stay conceptually aligned:

```python
class Mode(Protocol):
    id: str                                     # "world", "chars", ...
    title: str
    min_level: Level                            # BEGINNER | MAKER | ADVANCED

    def build_dock(self) -> QWidget: ...        # left inspector; every mode has one
    def render_tv(self, image: QImage) -> None: ...      # optional: take over the stage
    def render_overlay(self, painter: QPainter) -> None: ...  # grid, hover, entities
    def on_tv_press(self, cell: Cell, event) -> None: ...
    def on_tv_move(self, cell: Cell, event) -> None: ...
    def on_tv_release(self, cell: Cell, event) -> None: ...
    def on_key(self, event) -> bool: ...        # True if handled
    def refresh(self) -> None: ...              # store said something changed
```

---

## 3. Phase 0 — triage (half a day, do first)

These are shipped defects. Do them before any refactor so the refactor starts from
a working app.

### 0.1 Background switching crashes — `main_window.py:2234`

```python
self.statusBar().showMessage(f"WORLD layout changed to {dimensions[0]} × {dimensions[1]}")
```
`dimensions` is undefined in `_select_background()`. **Reproduced:** `NameError` on
every background change, raised *after* the document was mutated and autosaved, so
the UI half-updates. Line 2234 is also a copy-paste of the layout message and is
dead even once defined — delete it, keep 2235.

**Test:** `tests/ui/` — add a background, switch to it, assert no exception and
that `selected_background_index` moved. No existing test touches this path.

### 0.2 PALS renders white-on-white — `main_window.py:2557`

The theme rule lists `#rulesEditor`, `#tileEditor`, `#charsEditor` and their
`…Content` widgets, but never `#paletteEditor` / `#paletteEditorContent`. The
(currently uncommitted) `QScrollArea` conversion therefore falls back to Qt's
default white, with light-blue labels on it. Add both object names.

> This is the whole class of bug the theme's design invites: styling is one 47-line
> QSS string keyed by `objectName`, so **every new widget must be manually
> registered or it renders wrong**, and no test catches it. Phase 4.3 fixes the
> class; this fixes the instance.

### 0.3 `Open Project…` silently overwrites the current project

`main_window.py:2373` calls `import_project(..., replace_project_id=self._session.project_id)`
— opening a file **overwrites the currently open project's row** rather than
creating a new one, with no confirmation dialog. Create a new project; if replace
is ever wanted, ask first.

### 0.4 Remove the dev scaffolding shipped as UI

- `main_window.py:1177-1183` — the quest log is 5 hardcoded labels, all `done=True`
  ("Launch a real Qt application"). Delete; Phase 4.4 builds the real panel.
- `main_window.py:1190` — the notice "Development preview / No project files are
  modified by this shell." is **false**: the shell writes SQLite continuously.
  Delete it.

### 0.5 Keyboard basics

`Ctrl+S` (save), `F5` (build), `1`–`8` (mode switch). Today there is no `Ctrl+S`
at all — only `Save Project As…` (`main_window.py:2600`), which *exports* a JSON
copy while the real store is SQLite.

---

## 4. Phase 1 — the renderer (2–3 days). Unblocks everything.

### 4.1 `render/palette.py`

Port `NES_PALETTE_RGB` **verbatim** from `tools/tile_editor_web/sprite-render.js:29`
(64 entries, `[[0x62,0x62,0x62], [0x00,0x1F,0xB2], …]`).

```python
NES_PALETTE_RGB: tuple[tuple[int, int, int], ...]   # exactly 64 entries

def nes_rgb(index: int) -> tuple[int, int, int]: ...   # index & 0x3F
def nes_qcolor(index: int) -> QColor: ...
```

**Contract test** (`tests/contract/test_palette_parity.py`): parse the array out of
`sprite-render.js` and assert the Python table is byte-identical. This is exactly
the kind of cross-target invariant `tests/contract/` already exists to hold, and it
permanently kills the `_nes_colour_swatch()` class of bug.

### 4.2 `render/framebuffer.py`

```python
def render_nametable(doc, background_index, screen_x, screen_y) -> QImage   # 256x240
def render_tile(pixels, palette, *, bank) -> QImage                          # 8x8
def render_sprite(doc, sprite) -> QImage                                     # w*8 x h*8
```

Rules that must be honoured (the current code honours none of them):
- A cell's colour = `palette[value]`, where `palette` is the **2x2 attribute
  quadrant's** BG palette, not a per-tile choice.
- BG palette slot 0 is the **universal backdrop**, shared by all four palettes.
- Sprite palette slot 0 is **transparent**.

Format: **`QImage.Format_RGBX8888`**, not `RGBA8888` — see §5.3.

### 4.3 `render/screen.py` — `NesScreen`

The widget the whole app hangs off. Owns:
- a 256x240 `QImage`, drawn at **integer scale** with
  `Qt.TransformationMode.FastTransformation` (nearest-neighbour; anything else
  turns pixel art to mush);
- hover cell tracking → emits `hovered(x, y)` for the coordinate readout;
- an overlay hook so a mode can draw grid/attribute/entity/conflict layers on top;
- mouse press/move/release → `Cell` in **world** coordinates (not screen), because
  entities are world-space.

**Then delete** all five copies of the placeholder ramp and `_nes_colour_swatch()`.

### 4.4 Tests — the current suite's blind spot

180 tests pass today while the app renders a transparent screen and a white PALS
panel, because the tests assert `document.field == X` and **never assert that
anything renders**. Phase 1 must establish the missing habit:

- pixel assertions: render a known nametable, assert specific `QImage.pixel()`
  values;
- the palette-parity contract test above;
- a per-mode screenshot baseline (`QWidget.grab()`), which would have caught **both**
  Phase 0 bugs.

---

## 5. Phase 2 — Play in the stage (1–2 days). **Core already built.**

### 5.1 What exists

`native/nes_core/` — a PyO3 binding around **`tetanes-core`**, built and verified
on 2026-07-14.

- **Licence `MIT OR Apache-2.0`**, verified at source; no GPL/LGPL anywhere in its
  dependency tree. The project stays MIT.
- Ships as a self-contained `manylinux` abi3 wheel (568 KB). **Target machines need
  no Rust, no compiler, no apt packages** — the point, for locked-down school images.

```python
from nes_core import Nes
nes = Nes(44100.0)                      # must match the QAudioSink sample rate
nes.load_rom(rom_bytes)
nes.set_button(1, "right", True)        # player 1|2; up/down/left/right/a/b/start/select
pixels, samples = nes.clock_frame()     # 256x240 RGBA bytes + this frame's f32 audio
```

Measured against the real gallery ROM:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Speed | **119 fps** — 8.43 ms/frame against a 16.67 ms budget (~2x headroom) |
| Video | 91 distinct colours; the platformer renders correctly |
| Audio | 733.5 samples/frame at 44.1 kHz (expected 735), non-zero APU output |
| Input | Holding RIGHT changes the screen; bad player/button rejected |
| Qt blit + 2x scale | 0.26 ms/frame — 1.6% of budget, so Python can drive the loop |

### 5.2 Why not libretro

Every mature libretro core (fceumm, nestopia, quicknes — GPLv2; Mesen — GPLv3)
would force GPL onto an MIT school product, and Debian's `libretro-nestopia`
depends on `retroarch | libretro-frontend`, so an apt install drags in RetroArch.
`nes-py` has no APU at all. `cynes` emulates the APU but emits no samples.

> **Correction to `2026-06-22-wasm-emulator-spike.md`:** that doc claims "jsnes is
> already GPL, so we're very likely shipping under GPL terms today" and "a permissive
> NES core barely exists". **Both are false.** jsnes is Apache-2.0; the project today
> is cleanly MIT + Apache-2.0. Following that doc's reasoning would have quietly
> relicensed the product. The doc now carries a correction.

### 5.3 Two traps — both already hit, keep them written down

1. **Do not use `clock_frame_into()`.** It does
   `audio_samples.copy_from_slice(&audio[..audio_samples.len()])`, which **panics**
   unless the buffer length exactly equals the samples produced — and NES
   samples-per-frame varies (733/734/735 at 44.1 kHz). Use `clock_frame()` +
   `frame_buffer_into()` + a variable-length `audio_samples()` copy. `nes_core`
   already does this.
2. **Alpha is zero.** tetanes leaves the fourth byte at 0, so
   `QImage.Format_RGBA8888` renders a **fully transparent (white) screen**. Use
   **`Format_RGBX8888`**. This is the same reason `render/` must use RGBX (§4.2).

### 5.3a A third trap, found while wiring it up

**A machine with no audio device rendered nothing at all.** Pacing the loop on
`QAudioSink.bytesFree()` is correct — but when there is no sound card, `bytesFree()`
is permanently 0, so the loop never clocks a frame and Play shows a black screen.
`EmulatorSession` now falls back to a fixed 16 ms timestep when the sink fails to
open. On a locked-down school image with no working audio, the game must still be
playable.

### 5.4 `emulator/session.py`

```python
class EmulatorSession(QObject):
    frame_ready = Signal(QImage)
    def start(self, rom: bytes) -> None
    def stop(self) -> None
    def set_paused(self, paused: bool) -> None
    def key_event(self, event, pressed: bool) -> None
```

- **Clock the loop off `QAudioSink` buffer level, not a bare 16.67 ms `QTimer`.**
  A timer-driven loop drifts against the 44.1 kHz sink and underruns — this is
  precisely the bug the web hit and solved with a fixed-timestep loop plus a
  catch-up cap (`emulator.js:299-327`). Pull frames when the sink wants samples.
- `QAudioFormat`: 44100 Hz, mono, `Int16` (verified valid in the venv). Convert the
  core's `f32` samples.
- Input map — **match the web exactly** (`emulator.js:121-141`) so a pupil moving
  between browser and native does not have to relearn:
  P1 = Arrows, `F`=A, `D`=B, `Enter`=Start, `RShift`=Select;
  P2 = `I/J/K/L`, `O`=A, `U`=B, `1`=Start, `2`=Select.

### 5.5 Wiring

`NesScreen` (§4.3) shows either the **edited** framebuffer (LIVE) or the
**emulated** one (PLAYING) — the same widget, which is exactly why Phase 1 and
Phase 2 belong together. `▶ PLAY` builds (already threaded) then swaps the source.
Retire `integrations/fceux.py` as the primary path; keep an "Open in FCEUX" escape
hatch if it is installed.

---

## 6. Phase 3 — store + mode extraction (3–5 days). The unblocking refactor.

### 6.1 `state/store.py`

```python
class DocumentStore(QObject):
    changed = Signal(str)          # dotted path, e.g. "bg_tiles.9", "sprites.2.cells"
    dirty_changed = Signal(bool)

    def do(self, command: QUndoCommand) -> None   # the only way to mutate
    def undo(self) / redo(self)
```

Wrap `ProjectDocument`. Every edit becomes a `QUndoCommand` (`state/commands.py`).
The store owns the `QUndoStack` **and** calls `ProjectSession.schedule_save()` and
the title update itself.

This single change retires:
- 66 manual `schedule_save()` calls,
- 55 manual `_update_document_title()` calls,
- most of the 77 `blockSignals()` pairs,

and delivers the two things the user actually notices: **cross-mode refresh** (a
tile edit repaints WORLD) and **undo everywhere** — currently impossible to add.

**Migration order:** introduce the store alongside the existing direct mutations,
port one mode at a time, delete the old path last. `WorldCanvas`'s private history
(`world_canvas.py:56-58`) is deleted, which also fixes the "switching background
wipes undo" bug (`world_canvas.py:136`).

### 6.2 Fill `ui/modes/`

One `QWidget` per mode implementing the §2 protocol. Extraction order — easiest
first, so the pattern is proven before the hard ones:

`pals` → `tiles` → `sound` → `code` → `rules` → `style` (new) → `chars` → `world`.

`MainWindow` keeps only: app bar, mode rail, `NesScreen` stage, dock host, quest
panel, menus, build/play orchestration. Target **under 600 lines**.

### 6.3 Kill the nested-ternary dispatch

`main_window.py:1224-1243` — a nested ternary plus six sequential `if mode == …`
refresh blocks. Adding a mode currently means editing four places. Replace with a
mode registry keyed by id.

---

## 7. Phase 4 — make it look like the design guide (3–4 days)

### 7.1 Give every mode a dock

`main_window.py:1216` does `self.context_dock.setVisible(mode == "WORLD")` — the
inspector **only exists in WORLD**. In the other six modes the entire left column
vanishes and the editor form is stuffed inside the TV bezel, which is why RULES
reads as ~40 full-width spin boxes in a picture frame.

Every mode gets a dock (§2 `build_dock`). The stage goes back to being the stage.

### 7.2 Top app bar

Mirror `studio.html:422-457`: project name (live rename), **save-status dot**,
`▶ Play`, `Build`, `Tutorial`, `Help`, level select. Native currently has menus only.

### 7.3 Theme

Extract the 47-line inline QSS (`main_window.py:2539-2588`) into a real `.qss` with
design tokens. Adopt the web's discipline of **sourcing chrome colours from the real
NES system palette** (`studio.html:15-45`, each documented with its hex index).
Ship an app icon and mode-rail icons — there are currently **no image assets at
all**; every icon is procedurally painted at runtime.

Kill the label hacks: `Racer laps: 3` is a **spin-box prefix**, not a label. Group
RULES into cards. Hide racer fields in a platformer.

### 7.4 Real quest / attention panel

Replace the hardcoded checklist with: **CHR budget meters** (bg N/256, sprite N/256),
**OAM** (N/64), live quests, and validator output (§8.2) with **"Fix in \<Mode\> →"**
jump buttons.

---

## 8. Phase 5 — feature parity (ordered by value, cheap once 1–4 land)

1. **Project catalog** — switch / rename / duplicate / delete. `ProjectSession.switch()`
   already exists and is tested; **no UI reaches it**. Expose all **7 starters** —
   `StorageManager.projects()` is called exactly once (`main_window.py:121`) and
   `new_project()` (`:2528`) always hardcodes `"scratch"`, so `basics`, `geodash`,
   `racer`, `runner`, `smb` and `topdown` **ship on disk and are unreachable**.
2. **Validators** — port `builder-validators.js` to `core/validators.py`. Pure logic,
   no Qt, shareable, and **contract-testable against the web's output**. Highest
   value-per-risk item on this list.
3. **PALS** — correct for free after Phase 1. Add used-by counts, locked slot 0.
4. **CHARS composition canvas** — real metasprite painting on the stage via
   `render_tv`; pencil/fill/line/rect/select. Include the **shared-tile duplicate
   guard** (`studio-chars.js:283-326`) — the best teaching moment in the web app.
5. **WORLD viewport** — zoom, hover readout, **attribute-conflict overlay**,
   right-click eyedropper, fullscreen preview, richer block picker.
6. **STYLE mode** — the missing 8th mode; splits game-type tuning out of RULES.
7. **Time Machine UI** over the snapshots that already exist.
8. **CODE** — surface the build log (`NativeBuildResult.log` is **discarded** at
   `main_window.py:2434`), line numbers, snippets, restore-from-generated. Note CODE
   currently saves on **every keystroke** (`main_window.py:633`).
9. **Expertise levels** — gate modes/tools/dock sections. Keep the web's rule that
   locked modes stay **visible** with a nudge rather than disappearing.
10. `.chr` / `.pal` / `.nam` import/export; SOUND preview; accessibility prefs
    (text scale, high contrast).
11. **Guided tutorial** — largest single item; port last, reusing the web's
    declarative check list.

---

## 9. Explicitly out of scope

**Gallery / accounts / cloud publish.** These are server-coupled product decisions,
not native UI gaps. Recorded as a deliberate deferral rather than left implicitly
"missing".

---

## 10. Packaging

- Vendor the `nes_core` wheel (`native/nes_core/dist/`, 568 KB) so installation needs
  **no Rust toolchain**. Rust >= 1.85 is required on the *build* machine only.
- `native/nes_core/target/` (120 MB) is gitignored.
- Vendor the upstream MIT + Apache-2.0 licence texts alongside the wheel —
  attribution is the one obligation those licences impose.
- Engine-source files under `steps/Step_Playground/src/` are regenerated per build
  and must not be committed (see `CLAUDE.md`).

---

## 11. Testing policy — the change that matters most

**The current suite proves the ROM contract and nothing about the UI.** 180 tests
pass against an app with a transparent emulator frame, a white-on-white PALS panel,
and a `NameError` on background switch. Distribution today: `contract/` (strong),
`unit/` (document-level), `ui/` (**two tests**, one of which is a single 240-line
method that aborts everything after the first failure).

Add, in priority order:

1. **Pixel assertions** in `render/` — including the palette-parity contract test.
2. **Per-mode screenshot baselines** — would have caught both Phase 0 bugs.
3. **Per-mode widget tests**, replacing the monolith in `tests/ui/test_shell.py`.
4. **Emulator smoke test** — load the gallery ROM, clock 300 frames, assert a
   non-blank frame and non-zero audio. (Already written as a scratch script during
   Phase 2; promote it.)
5. **Failure-path tests** — the `QMessageBox` branches at `main_window.py:1434,
   1560, 2228, 2244, 2311, 2378, 2392, 2459, 2476` are **all untested**.

`pytest-qt` is a declared dev dependency but `qtbot` is never used; only the `qapp`
fixture. There is no `QTest.mouseClick` anywhere, so drag-painting, entity drag and
rubber-band selection are tested only through the direct `edit_cell()` API, never
through the actual mouse handlers.

## 12. Sequencing and effort

| Phase | Work | Effort | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Triage: 3 bugs, dev scaffolding, shortcuts | 0.5 d | — |
| 1 | `render/` — palette, framebuffer, `NesScreen` | 2–3 d | everything visual |
| 2 | Play in the stage (core **done**) | 1–2 d | needs `NesScreen` |
| 3 | `DocumentStore` + fill `ui/modes/` | 3–5 d | undo, cross-mode refresh |
| 4 | Docks, app bar, theme, quest panel | 3–4 d | needs modes |
| 5 | Parity features (§8) | 3–4 w | needs 1–4 |

Phases 0–4 are sequential; **Phase 5 parallelises freely** once they land. Phases 1
and 2 are best done together — they share `NesScreen`, and Phase 2 is what finally
makes the CRT bezel mean something.

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| The Phase 3 refactor stalls mid-way, leaving two mutation paths | Port **one mode at a time**, keep tests green at every step, delete the old path last. |
| Audio underrun / drift in the frame loop | Clock off `QAudioSink` buffer level, not a `QTimer` (§5.4). This is a known, already-solved bug in the web. |
| Screenshot baselines are brittle across Qt/font versions | Assert on a downscaled/quantised image, or on specific pixels, not on exact file hashes. |
| Rendering real tiles is slower than the placebo | Cache tile `QImage`s, invalidate on `changed("bg_tiles.N")`. Budget is generous: the emulator already leaves ~8 ms/frame spare. |
| `tetanes-core` becomes unmaintained | The Python API is core-neutral by design; `plastic_core` (MIT, Rust, full APU) is a drop-in-shaped fallback — one file changes. |
